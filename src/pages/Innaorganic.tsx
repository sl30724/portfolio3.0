                    <p>Inna Organic, a prominent Asian organic skincare brand, embarked on a strategic mission to expand its presence within the competitive North American market. As the exclusive in-house UX Designer within the dynamic marketing team, I undertook a transformative project aimed at revitalizing their e-commerce platform. Over the course of a rigorous 12-week journey, the primary goal was to enhance brand communication and bridge the existing gap between the website and North American audiences.</p>

                    <p>The initial challenge lay in the evident disconnection between the current website and the diverse audiences in North America. It was clear that consumers in this region struggled to resonate with the existing online experience offered by Inna Organic.</p>

                <p>By identifying constraints early in the project, we gain a precise understanding of the boundaries within which I must operate. This knowledge enables me to make informed decisions and strategic trade-offs. For this project, there are two main constraints: <span style={{ color: "var(--primary)", fontWeight: 500 }}>insufficient current website data</span> & <span style={{ color: "var(--primary)", fontWeight: 500 }}>limited original audience base</span>.</p>

                <p>Given the project's timeline and constraints, I strategically chose research methods that would yield maximum insights while respecting our limitations. To effectively navigate this balance, I opted for a two-pronged approach: <span style={{ color: "var(--primary)", fontWeight: 500 }}>competitor analysis</span> and <span style={{ color: "var(--primary)", fontWeight: 500 }}>user interviews</span>.</p>

                <h4 className='gradientText'>Competitor Analysis</h4>
                <p>In the pursuit of valuable market insights, I conducted an extensive competitor analysis encompassing 13 prominent natural/organic skincare brands renowned for their North American cult followings. This deep-dive exploration offered a holistic view of industry dynamics, helping us <span style={{ color: "var(--primary)", fontWeight: 500 }}>assess our current performance, identify industry trends, and analyze user expectations</span>.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Moreover, this analysis provided a roadmap for innovation, guiding us to design solutions that not only met market expectations but surpassed them. As a result of this intensive process, I distilled <span style={{ color: "var(--primary)", fontWeight: 500 }}>four pivotal market insights</span> that would underpin our design strategy.

                <p>Even within the constraints of a tight timeline, I placed a high premium on the power of user insights. To achieve this, I embarked on targeted user interviews with a cohort of six individuals, ranging in age from 25 to 40, each having made online purchases from at least two natural skincare brands in North America within the past year. This approach offered a direct line to our potential audience, enabling us to understand <span style={{ color: "var(--primary)", fontWeight: 500 }}>their needs, preferences, and pain points</span>.

                <h4 className='gradientText'>Defining Solutions with Insights</h4>
                <p>Drawing from the valuable insights gathered through both competitor analysis and user interviews, I crafted the foundational components, functionalities, and emotional resonance that would shape our final design solution. When delving into the user interviews, three critical themes emerged consistently: <span style={{ color: "var(--primary)", fontWeight: 500 }}>Community, Knowledge, and Trustworthiness</span>. From there, I further refined the approach to these core themes based on the strategic findings from the competitor analysis.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It's important to highlight that participants emphasized the significance of a seamless check-out experience. Unfortunately, due to project constraints, we were unable to address this aspect within the scope of this iteration.
